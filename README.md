# PyBer-analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, and then create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type, to analyze how the data differs by city type, and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer, provide business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

## Results

Through analysis and aggregation of PyBers ride sharing data, I have created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type:

A multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type as below:

By reviewing the summary we can see that there are several key findings including:

Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.

Urban cities have 4x+ more drivers than suburban cities, suburban cities have 6x + drivers than rural with almost 4.5x the revenue.

Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.

The summary data shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides.


## Summary
Based on the analysis my business recommendations to Pyber are: 

Increasing the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand. 

Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than Suburban and urban cities.This can indicate that rural area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. This can result in a majority of drivers being occupied with current trips and loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business.

We can see that there is a revenue peak for all city types at the third week of Feb, so it might also be the good timing to increase drivers for all areas.
